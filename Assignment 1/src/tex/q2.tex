Assume the probability of a certain disease is \textbf{0.01}. The probability of test positive given thata person is infected with the disease is \textbf{0.95} and the probability of test positive given theperson is not infected with the disease is \textbf{0.05}.

\begin{parts}
    \part Calculate the probability of test positive.
    \part Use Bayes’ Rule to calculate the probability of being infected with the disease given that the test is positive.

\begin{solution}

    Let:
    \[
        P(D)=0.01, \quad P(\neg D)=0.99,
    \]
    \[
        P(+|D)=0.95, \quad P(+|\neg D)=0.05,
    \]
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $D$ = event that a person \emph{has} the disease,
        \item $\neg D$ = event that a person \emph{does not have} the disease,
        \item $(+)$ = event that the test result is \emph{positive}.
    \end{itemize}

        \part Probability of testing positive.

        We apply the \textbf{law of total probability}:
        \[
            P(+)=P(+|D)P(D)+P(+|\neg D)P(\neg D).
        \]

        Substitute the given values:
        \[
            P(+)= (0.95)(0.01) + (0.05)(0.99).
        \]

        Compute step-by-step:
        \[
            P(+)= 0.0095 + 0.0495 = 0.059.
        \]

        \[
            \boxed{P(+)=0.059.}
        \]

        \hrule

        \part Probability of being infected given that the test is positive.

        We apply \textbf{Bayes' Rule}:
        \[
            P(D|+)=\frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+)}.
        \]

        Substitute known quantities:
        \[
            P(D|+)=\frac{(0.95)(0.01)}{0.059}.
        \]

        Calculate:
        \[
            P(D|+)=\frac{0.0095}{0.059}\approx0.161.
        \]

        \[
            \boxed{P(D|+)\approx0.161.}
        \]
